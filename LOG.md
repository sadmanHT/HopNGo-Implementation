- ✅ Added `.prettierignore` for excluding files
- ✅ Created `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings

### 5. Commit Standards

- ✅ Set up Husky for Git hooks
- ✅ Added commit-msg hook to enforce commit message standards

### 6. GitHub Templates
- ✅ Created issue templates:
  - Bug report template

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Port**: 3000
- **Status**: ✅ Active

### Backend Services (Planned)
- **API Gateway**: Spring Boot + Spring Cloud Gateway (Port 8080)
- **Microservices**: Spring Boot + JPA (Ports 8081-8089)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ

### Development Tools
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig
- **Commit Standards**: Conventional Commits + Husky + commitlint
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes + Helm

## Infrastructure Setup (2025-01-04)

### Docker Compose Infrastructure

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml` with all required services
- ✅ Created `infra/compose/.env` with secure development credentials
- ✅ Created management scripts (`scripts/dev.sh`, `scripts/down.sh`)
- ✅ Created database test scripts (`scripts/test-postgres.sh`, `scripts/test-mongo.sh`)
- ✅ Successfully started all infrastructure services
- ✅ Updated README with comprehensive infrastructure documentation

**Services Deployed:**
- PostgreSQL 15 (port 5432) - ✅ Healthy
- MongoDB 7 (port 27017) - ✅ Healthy  
- Redis 7 (port 6379) - ✅ Healthy
- RabbitMQ 3 Management (ports 5672, 15672) - ✅ Healthy
- Mailhog (ports 1025, 8025) - ✅ Healthy

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Container Name Conflicts**: Existing containers with same names were blocking startup
   - **Solution**: Added cleanup commands to remove conflicting containers
   - **Commands**: `docker rm -f hopngo-*` before starting services

2. **Docker Compose Version Warning**: Obsolete `version` field causing warnings
   - **Solution**: Removed `version: '3.8'` from docker-compose.yml
   - **Impact**: Cleaner output, no functional changes

3. **PowerShell Command Syntax**: `&&` operator not supported in PowerShell
   - **Solution**: Used `;` separator instead of `&&` for command chaining
   - **Example**: `cd infra/compose; docker compose up -d`

**Health Check Results:**
```
NAME              STATUS
hopngo-mailhog    Up 27 seconds (healthy)
hopngo-mongodb    Up 27 seconds (healthy)
hopngo-postgres   Up 27 seconds (healthy)
hopngo-rabbitmq   Up 27 seconds (healthy)
hopngo-redis      Up 27 seconds (healthy)
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Development-only credentials with clear naming convention
- All passwords include environment identifier (`_dev_2024!`)
- Services bound to localhost only for security
- Named volumes for data persistence

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. Implement API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway
2. Create Authentication service with JWT
3. Set up Docker containerization
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Short-term (Phase 2)
5. Develop core microservices (Social, Booking, Market)
6. Implement real-time chat functionality
7. Set up PostgreSQL database integration
8. Create basic trip planning features

### Medium-term (Phase 3)
9. Add AI-powered recommendations
10. Implement emergency assistance system
11. Set up push notification service
12. Integrate Elasticsearch for advanced search

### Long-term (Phase 4)
13. Deploy to Kubernetes
14. Implement monitoring and observability
15. Performance optimization and scaling
16. Multi-region deployment

## Verification Checklist

## Notes

- The transformation maintains backward compatibility with the existing frontend application

- Infrastructure configurations are prepared for future Docker and Kubernetes deployment
- All code quality standards are enforced through automated tools and Git hooks
- The mono-repo structure supports independent development and deployment of microservices
